# Skill: PolicyEngine — policy-conditional distributions

PolicyEngine is the microsimulation instrument: when a forecast turns on a
tax-benefit parameter or a reform's aggregate impact, call it instead of
estimating by analogy. It is an explicit MODEL INPUT, never ground truth —
the trace says which policy ids ran and treats the output as one evidence
stream with its own error bars.

## Endpoints
- Household calc + policy metadata: `https://api.policyengine.org/us/...`
  (policy by id: `/us/policy/<id>`; current-law verification = fetch the
  policy and confirm parameters).
- Economy-wide impacts: `/us/economy/<reform_id>/over/<baseline_id>?region=us&time_period=<year>`
  — returns queued→computing→ok; budgetary impact in the result. Queued or
  errored runs WIDEN the interval; say so rather than waiting silently
  (the live forecast-api treats this the same way).
- UK mirror under `/uk/`.

## Calibration of PolicyEngine outputs
Static microsim impacts differ from official scores (CBO/JCT) by behavioral
and timing effects. Keep a stored ratio/additive prior from past
PolicyEngine-vs-official comparisons and apply it, with the adjustment shown
in a math step. Cells whose resolution source IS an official score must
forecast the official score, not the raw microsim number.

## When to call it
- `conditionalOn` references a tax/benefit parameter: simulate both arms.
- Forecasting program aggregates (CTC outlays, SNAP benefits): baseline run
  + trend adjustment.
- Never for series PolicyEngine doesn't model (CPI, claims) — the trace
  should not contain decorative microsim calls.
