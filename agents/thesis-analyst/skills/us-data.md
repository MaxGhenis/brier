# Skill: US statistical data — sources, mirrors, calendars

## Fetch patterns (history)
- FRED CSV mirror, no key needed:
  `https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?id=<SERIES>`
  Workhorse series: ICSA (initial claims, SA), UNRATE, PAYEMS (diff for
  monthly change), CPIAUCSL (CPI-U SA), CPILFESL (core CPI SA), PCEPILFE
  (core PCE), RSAFS (retail sales), HOUST (housing starts SAAR), INDPRO,
  JTSJOL (JOLTS openings), DFEDTARU (fed funds target upper), MTSDS133FMS
  (monthly Treasury deficit/surplus).
  FRED is a fetch mirror only — resolution always cites the agency print.
- BLS API (no key, 25 req/day): `https://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v2/timeseries/data/<SERIES_ID>`
- Census economic indicators: release pages under
  `https://www.census.gov/economic-indicators/` (advance retail sales,
  residential construction).
- Census ACS/decennial tables, keyless JSON:
  `https://data.census.gov/api/access/data/table?id=<PRODUCT><YEAR>.<TABLE>&g=010XX00US`
  (e.g. `ACSDT1Y2024.B28005`; `g=010XX00US` = United States). The response
  is `{"response":{"data":[[header row],[value row]]}}` — read the exact
  variable columns named by the resolver. `api.census.gov` now REQUIRES an
  API key (keyless requests 302-redirect to `missing_key.html` with an
  empty body), so never rely on it in keyless runs. The hosted web-search
  tool cannot fetch these JSON endpoints (it fails with "Cache miss");
  fetch them with `curl -sS` in a network-enabled run and read values only
  from the echoed response. If the fetch fails, fail the run honestly —
  never present remembered values as fetched ones.

## ACS vintage discipline
- Never mix ACS 5-year estimates into a 1-year series: the 5-year file is
  a five-year average, so its level trails the 1-year series. Verified for
  B28005 65+ broadband, United States: 5-year 2024 = 84.6, which is close
  to 1-year 2022 = 84.8, while 1-year 2024 = 88.2. The product id in the
  fetch URL (`ACSDT1Y` vs `ACSDT5Y`) is the vintage authority — match it
  to the resolver's product for every history year, and label each
  historicalContext entry with its vintage.
- A run that cannot fetch does NOT quietly fall back to another vintage.
  The 2026-07 broadband-65+ runs reported 79.4/81.6/83.5/84.8 for
  2021-2024, which matches NEITHER the 1-year file
  (83.1/84.8/86.5/88.2) NOR the 5-year file (78.6/80.6/82.6/84.6), and
  cited raw counts wrong by up to 2.3 million. Plausible-looking numbers
  with no published source are the failure mode: echo the fetch, or fail
  the run and say the fetch failed.

## Release calendars (verify every release-calendar resolutionDate here)

Resolve-by-bound targets instead use the registered bound and exact official
announcement supplied in their target context.
- BLS: `https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/` (CPI, Employment
  Situation, JOLTS, PPI)
- BEA: `https://www.bea.gov/news/schedule` (PCE, GDP)
- Census: `https://www.census.gov/economic-indicators/calendar-listview.html`
- Federal Reserve: `https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm`
  (FOMC meeting/decision dates), G.17 schedule on the IP release page
- DOL claims: released Thursdays 8:30 ET; weekly schedule at
  `https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf` / `https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/claims.asp`

## Gotchas
- Claims cells name the WEEK ENDING date; the release is the following
  Thursday. Both dates appear in the question/rule respectively.
- PAYEMS is a level; the headline is the monthly CHANGE — diff it and say so.
- Retail sales advance print revises heavily; first print is what resolves.
- FOMC: the resolvable number is the target RANGE upper bound in the
  implementation note, not the midpoint.
